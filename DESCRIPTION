Description: Functions that fit gamma frailty model with spline or piecewise 
    constant baseline rate function for recurrent event data, compute, 
    and plot parametric mean cumulative function (MCF) from a fitted model 
    as well as nonparametric sample MCF (Nelson-Aalen estimator) are provided. 
    The most functions are S4 methods that produce S4 class objects.
