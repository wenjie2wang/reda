Description: Functions for (1) simulating survival, recurrent event, and
    multiple event data from stochastic process point of view, (2) exploring
    and modeling recurrent event data through the mean cumulative function (MCF)
    or also called the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard rate
    function, and gamma frailty model with spline rate function, and (3)
    comparing two-sample recurrent event responses with the pseudo-score tests.
