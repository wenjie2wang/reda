##' Recurrent Event Data Analysis
##'
##' The R package \pkg{reda} provides functions for simulating, exploring and
##' modeling recurrent event data.
##'
##' The main functions are summarized as follows:
##' \itemize{
##'
##' \item \code{simEventData}: Simulating survival, recurrent event, and
##' multiple event data from stochastic process point of view.
##'
##' \item \code{mcf}: Estimating the mean cumulative function (MCF) from a
##' fitted gamma frailty model, or from a sample recurrent event data by using
##' the nonparametic MCF estimator (the Nelson-Aelen estimator of the cumulative
##' hazard function).
##'
##' \item \code{mcfDiff}: Comparing two-sample MCFs by the pseudo-score tests
##' and estimating their difference over time.
##'
##' \item \code{rateReg}: Fitting Gamma fraitly model with spline baseline rate
##' function.
##' }
##'
##' See the package vignettes for more introduction and demonstration.
