# reda 0.5.6

## Minor changes

* Moved packages {ggplot2} and {grDevices} to *Suggests* as they are needed for
  `plot()` methods only.
* Updated testing examples for `ggplot` objects.


# reda 0.5.5

## Minor changes

* Updated the testing example for the `plot()` method for `mcf,formula-method`
  and fixed a typo in function documentation.


# reda 0.5.4

## Minor changes

* The `show()` method for `Recur` class objects prints in the same order as the
  internally sorted ID's.
* Added a new argument named `rhoMax` to the function `simEvent()` for users to
  specify an upper bound of the rate function in case the function cannot
  determine an appropriate upper bound
  internally. [#7](https://github.com/wenjie2wang/reda/issues/7)


# reda 0.5.3

## Minor changes

* Added `summary()` method for `Recur()` objects.
* Added a new slot named `time_class` to `Recur()` object.
* Updated the `id` slot of `Recur()` object to unique ID's.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed empty MCF estimates when `adjustRiskset = FALSE` is specified.
* Fixed slot `first_idx` and `last_idx` in `Recur` object.


# reda 0.5.2

## Minor changes

* Used `deriv` method from **splines2** objects for derivatives instead of
  extraction of attributions.


# reda 0.5.1

## New features

* Added a new option `variance = "none"` to return sample MCF estimates without
  variance estimates.

## Minor changes

* Removed titles in `plot()` method for `mcf` objects for a more minimal output
  by default.


# reda 0.5.0

## New features

* Added function `Recur()` as a successor or function `Survr()` for model
  formula response.

* Added a new package vignette introducing the function `Recur()`.

* Added a new argument `adjustRiskset` to the method `mcf.formula()` for
  specifying whether to adjust the size of risk set.  The cumulative sample mean
  function estimates will be computed by setting `adjustRiskset = FALSE`.

* Added a new option of `"CSV"` for cumulative sample variance estimates to the
  argument `variance` of the method `mcf.formula`.

## Major changes

* The function `Survr` is deprecated since this version and will be removed in
  future.

* Added implementation of nonparametric MCF estimates in **C++** with help of
  **Rcpp** and replaced original implementation in **R** with the new
  implementation for a better computational performance.

## Minor changes

* Updated testing suite by using **tinytest** instead of **testthat**.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed `numRisk` (the size of risk set) for tied censoring times in
  `mcf.formula` objects returned from method `mcf.formula`.  Thank William
  Anderson (wnilesanderson AT gmail.com) for bug reporting with detailed
  examples.


# reda 0.4.1

## Bug fixes

* Fixed compiling errors when using clang.


# reda 0.4.0

## New features

* Added function `simEvent` and `simEventData` for simulating survival,
  recurrent event, and multiple event data from stochastic process point of
  view.

* Added function `mcfDiff` and `mcfDiff.test` for comparing two-sample MCFs by
  difference estimates over time and the pseudo-score tests.

* Added argument `origin` to function `Survr` for modeling processes with
  different time origins.

* Added variance estimates of sample MCF from bootstrap methods.

## Major changes

* Updated checking rule of argument `event` of function `Survr` for modeling
  sample MCF of cost in addition to number of events.

* Updated Lawless and Nadaeu (1995) variance estimates in method `mcf.formula`
  for sample MCF.

* Renamed class `sampleMcf` to `mcf.formula`, `rateRegMcf` to `mcf.rateReg`,
  `baseRateReg` to `baseRate.rateReg`, `summaryRateReg` to `summary.rateReg`.

## Minor changes

* Allowed formula `Survr(ID, time, event) ~ 1` for modeling baseline rate
  function using gamma frailty model in function `rateReg` without specifying
  any covariate.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed possible label mismatching in `plot,mcf.formula` (previously
  `plot,sampleMcf`) method.


# reda 0.3.1

## New features

* Added estimated baseline rate function and its confidence band, and
  corresponding plot method.

## Major changes

* Updated function `baseRate` for estimated baseline rate function instead of
  the estimated coefficients of spline bases.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed function `confint` by specifying the correct standard error column.


# reda 0.3.0

## New features

* Added M-spline for modeling baseline rate to function `rateReg`.

* Added argument `check` to function `rateReg` so that it is possible to skip
  the data checking step to slightly speed up the model fitting for cleaned
  data.

* Added option `verbose` to argument `control` of function `rateReg` to suppress
  all possible messages.

* Added variance estimates for sample MCF by Poisson process method, and
  confidence interval based on the asymptotic normality of MCF itself (in
  addition to the logarithm of MCF) to function `mcf,formula-method`.

* Allowed multiple categorical variables in function `mcf,formula-method` for
  the sample MCF for design with multiple factors.

* Added sample valve-seat dataset from Nelson (1995) for demonstration.

## Major changes

* Borrowed the power from R package **splines2** for piece-wise constant and
  splines based baseline rate function, and thus boosted the performance of
  **reda** in model fitting.

* Updated object class of fitted model, `rateReg`.

* Replaced generic function `plotMcf` with methods for function `plot`.

* Updated data checking procedure for a better performance.

* Added variable "gender" in sample simulated dataset, `simuDat` for a better
  demonstration of sample MCF function.

## Minor changes

* Renamed all slot named `boundaryKnots` to `Boundary.knots` for consistency
  with spline functions.

* Updated vignettes for demonstration of new features.

* Added sample citation entry for **reda**.


# reda 0.2.1

## New features

* Implementation of spline baseline rate function.

* Added function `AIC` and `BIC`.

## Major changes

* Renamed main function name from `heart` to `rateReg` and added new argument.

* Updated object class of fitted model.

* Replaced sample simulated dataset for demonstration.

## Bug fixes

* Updated S4 method `plotMcf,sampleMcf`: Replaced `show_guide` with
  `show.legend` in function `geom_text` to incorporate updates in package
  `ggplot2` v1.0.1.

* Minor updates that clear checking note from CRAN.


# reda 0.1.0

## New features

* First version of reda mainly providing function to fit gamma frailty model
  with piece-wise constant baseline rate function for recurrent event data.
